## Detailed Analysis

### S7P1: Apply quality gates
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Evaluation reports generated in JSON/table format via `evalscope.report` module
- Performance benchmarking available through `evalscope perf` with metrics like TTFT, TPOP
- Manual threshold checking possible through report analysis
- Stress testing with configurable parameters (`--parallel`, `--number`, `--rate`)
- Example stress test configuration in `/evalscope/perf/arguments.py`
**Limitations:**
- No automated quality gate enforcement or threshold-based pass/fail mechanisms  
- No built-in regression detection against historical baselines
- No automated safety checks or validation rules
- Requires manual interpretation of results and custom scripting for gates

### S7P2: Validate regulatory compliance
**Rating:** 0
**Evidence:**
- No bias metrics or fairness assessment capabilities found in codebase
- No explainability tools or audit trails in the framework
- No compliance documentation templates (GDPR, AI Act, etc.)
- Standard accuracy/performance metrics only (Rouge, BLEU, accuracy)
**Limitations:**
- Framework focuses on performance evaluation, not regulatory compliance
- No bias detection, fairness metrics, or demographic parity assessments
- No explainability or interpretability features
- Would require entirely external tools for compliance validation

### S7P3: Monitor production drift and performance degradation
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Performance monitoring via `evalscope perf` module for inference metrics
- Stress testing capabilities for model service evaluation
- Basic monitoring of TTFT (Time to First Token) and throughput metrics
- Performance benchmarking against different configurations
- Database storage for performance results (`evalscope/perf/utils/db_util.py`)
**Limitations:**
- No data drift or concept drift detection capabilities
- No automated alerting mechanisms for performance degradation
- No built-in comparison against historical performance baselines
- Monitoring focuses on inference performance, not model quality drift

### S7P4: Document reproducibility
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive configuration management via `TaskConfig` class in `config.py`
- Detailed parameter tracking including model args, generation config, dataset args
- Structured report generation with experiment metadata
- Support for seed setting in generation config for reproducible sampling
- Experiment tracking through visualization tools (Gradio app, Wandb/SwanLab integration)
- Example configs preserved in evaluation reports
**Limitations:**
- No automated reproducibility validation or verification
- Limited version tracking of datasets and model artifacts
- No lineage tracking of data transformations
- Reproducibility documentation requires manual compilation

### S7P5: Plan iteration cycles
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Basic hyperparameter configuration through `generation_config` parameters
- Support for temperature, top_p, top_k, max_tokens, and other sampling parameters
- Arena mode for comparative model evaluation across configurations
- Dataset configuration flexibility with subset selection and prompt templating
- Integration with ms-swift training framework mentioned in documentation
**Limitations:**
- No built-in hyperparameter optimization or tuning frameworks
- No automated prompt engineering or optimization tools
- No dataset expansion or active learning capabilities
- Manual iteration planning required; no systematic optimization workflows

### S7P6: Integrate feedback loops from production monitoring
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Arena mode supports comparative evaluation between models
- Support for A/B testing style comparisons through pairwise evaluation
- Basic model ranking and win rate calculations
- Integration capabilities with external APIs for evaluation
- Visualization tools for comparing model performance across evaluations
**Limitations:**
- No direct production metrics integration or feedback APIs
- No online learning or continuous model improvement mechanisms
- Arena mode is offline evaluation, not real-time production feedback
- No user feedback collection or incorporation mechanisms
- Requires external systems for production monitoring integration
