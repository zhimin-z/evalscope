| S5P5 | 2 | Multi-model comparison with radar charts and tables, no significance testing |

## Detailed Analysis

### S5P1: Compute aggregate statistics
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive statistical functions in `evalscope/metrics/metrics.py`: `mean()`, `median()`, `pop_stddev()`, `sample_stddev()`, `mean_stderr()`
- Weighted aggregation support with `weighted_mean()`, `micro_mean()`, and `macro_mean()` functions
- Report aggregation in `evalscope/report/report.py` with multi-level aggregation (subset → category → metric)
- Configuration example shows aggregation at dataset and subset levels in report JSONs
- Missing: percentile calculations, robust statistics for outliers, custom aggregation function framework
**Limitations:**
- No built-in percentile or quartile calculations (except in perf module)
- Limited support for custom aggregation functions beyond provided ones
- No explicit handling of missing data or outlier detection utilities

### S5P2: Perform stratified analysis
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Basic category-based grouping in report structure via `categories` field in JSON reports
- Category mapping in `evalscope/api/benchmark/adapters/default_data_adapter.py` 
- No dedicated stratification tools or multi-dimensional slicing capabilities
- No fairness or bias analysis tools found in codebase
**Limitations:**
- Categories are simple string labels, not multi-dimensional metadata
- No group-by operations beyond basic category aggregation  
- No demographic or fairness analysis capabilities
- Requires manual implementation for complex stratification

### S5P3: Generate diagnostic visualizations
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Gradio-based visualization dashboard in `evalscope/app/` with plotting utilities in `evalscope/app/utils/visualization.py`
- Plotly-based charts: bar charts (`plot_single_report_scores`), sunburst plots (`plot_single_report_sunburst`), radar charts (`plot_multi_report_radar`)
- Visualization documentation at `docs/en/get_started/visualization.md` shows model comparison and dataset overview features
- No confusion matrices, ROC curves, PR curves, or calibration plots found
**Limitations:**
- Limited to basic performance visualization (scores, comparisons)
- No diagnostic plots for error analysis or model calibration
- No interactive exploration tools beyond basic filtering
- Cannot generate confusion matrices or classification diagnostic plots

### S5P4: Analyze performance-quality tradeoffs and failure patterns
**Rating:** 1
**Evidence:**
- Performance benchmarking module in `evalscope/perf/` with latency, throughput, and TTFT metrics
- Performance analysis in `evalscope/perf/utils/rich_display.py` with `analyze_results()` function
- Percentile calculations for latency metrics (P99) in `evalscope/perf/utils/db_util.py`
- No quality vs performance tradeoff analysis or systematic failure pattern detection
**Limitations:**
- Performance monitoring exists but separate from accuracy evaluation
- No integrated tradeoff analysis between performance and quality metrics
- No systematic failure pattern detection or error clustering capabilities
- No root cause analysis or bias detection frameworks

### S5P5: Rank and compare models against baselines
**Rating:** 2
**Evidence:**
- Multi-model comparison functionality in `evalscope/app/ui/multi_model.py` and visualization utilities
- Report comparison tables generated by `evalscope/report/combinator.py` with `gen_table()` function
- Radar chart comparisons and side-by-side model evaluation in visualization dashboard
- Example configurations show model comparison across datasets
- Missing: statistical significance testing, formal leaderboards, baseline tracking
**Limitations:**
- No statistical significance testing for model comparisons
- No formal leaderboard generation or ranking algorithms
- No baseline tracking or relative improvement metrics
- Comparisons are primarily visual/tabular without statistical validation

## Overall Assessment

EvalScope provides **partial support** for Step 5 (ANALYZE) processes with an average rating of **1.6/3**. The framework excels in basic evaluation and comparison but lacks advanced analytical capabilities:

**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation for metric aggregation and reporting
- Good visualization dashboard for basic model comparison
- Structured report format enables programmatic analysis
- Multi-model comparison with visual tools

**Key Gaps:**
- No advanced statistical analysis or diagnostic plotting
- Limited stratification beyond basic categories  
- No failure pattern analysis or tradeoff evaluation
- Missing statistical significance testing for comparisons

The framework appears designed primarily for evaluation rather than deep analysis, requiring significant custom development for advanced analytical workflows.
